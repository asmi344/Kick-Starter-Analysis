Performing analysis on Github to find trends 
Fundraising Analysis

Overview
	The purpose of this project is to help Louise see how other plays did in comparison to her play “Fever” in their fundraising goals.  We looked at data from the Parent Category Theater to see trends in the Launch Dates to see if there are any trends for successful, failed and canceled fundraisers.  Also, we were able to look at the percentage of successful, failed or canceled fundraisers by the amount that their goal was.  

Analysis and Challenges
	There were some difficulties that were encountered during the analysis of the Fundraisers.  The first challenged we ran into was how to sort the data.   There were over 5,000 fundraisers that we had to sort through to make the analysis the best for Louise.  Seeing that she was focused on theater and plays we could narrow down the amount of information that was relevant to the success of her fundraiser for the play.  Secondly there were a lot of things that could have been analyzed during the analysis.  We could have looked arranging the data by country or by currency, number or donors, average amount of donation, etc.  Looking at the date for Theater outcome based on Launch date and percentage of failed, successful, and cancelled outcome compared to the goal was the best for Louise.   

Results

Some conclusion that can be made based on the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date are that during May through September, there is a higher chance of having a successful fundraising campaign.  Also, you have a higher chance of having a successful Fundraiser compared to a failed one.  We do see in the line graph that there are more successful fundraisers ever month the only time the failed fundraisers are remarkably close to equaling the successful fundraisers is in the month of December.  Also, we see that during the month of May that over 100 fundraisers were successful compared to around 52 failed.  
Looking at the outcomes based on goals we can see that; higher fundraiser goals have a higher chance of failing compared to goals with lower amounts.  Looking at goals less than $1,000 there was a success rate close to 80% and looking at goals that were above $45,000 almost all the fundraisers failed.  
The main limitation to the data is that there are so much that this can go in many ways.  We could have looked the number of successful fundraisers by year started and not month.  Also, we could have broken the data down by the description of the plays.  For example, some plays are drama, others are comedies.  Breaking the information down by Genre or type will help provide additional information.
